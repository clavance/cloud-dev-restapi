# Udagram REST API

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the [Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/). It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [Frontend](https://github.com/clavance/udagram/tree/master/frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. [RestAPI Backend](https://github.com/clavance/udagram/tree/master/restapi), a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service.
3. [Image Filtering Microservice](https://github.com/clavance/udagram/tree/master/filter-backend), the final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.
